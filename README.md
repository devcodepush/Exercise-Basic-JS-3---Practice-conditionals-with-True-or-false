### Solution

```javascript
const responseOne = prompt(
  "Tomatoes are fruits, not vegetables: true or false"
);
const responseTwo = prompt(
  "You should drink 8 glasses of water: true or false"
);
const responseThree = prompt(
  "Fishes have only three seconds of memory: true or false"
);
const responseFour = prompt(
  "The Great Wall of China is the only man made structure visible from space The Great Wall of China: true or false"
);

function responseChecker() {
  if (responseOne === "true") {
    console.log("correct");
  } else {
    console.log("incorrect");
  }
  if (responseTwo === "true") {
    console.log("correct");
  } else {
    console.log("incorrect");
  }
  if (responseThree === "false") {
    console.log("correct");
  } else {
    console.log("incorrect");
  }
  if (responseFour === "true") {
    console.log("correct");
